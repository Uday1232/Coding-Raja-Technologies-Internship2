HTML Structure: The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the music player application. It includes elements for displaying the music library, audio controls, and progress bar. Each track in the library is represented by an image (album cover) and text (track name and artist).

CSS Styling: The CSS file (styles.css) provides styles to format the layout of the application, including the positioning and appearance of various elements like buttons, progress bars, and track information.

JavaScript Functionality: The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the logic for controlling the music player. It handles tasks such as loading and playing audio tracks, toggling play/pause, moving to the next or previous track, shuffling tracks, repeating tracks, adjusting volume, and updating the progress bar.

Event Listeners: Event listeners are set up to respond to user interactions with the player's controls. For example, clicking on play/pause buttons triggers the togglePlay() function, while clicking on next/previous buttons triggers nextTrack() and prevTrack() functions respectively.

Audio Element: The element is used to load and play audio tracks. It is hidden from the user interface but is manipulated programmatically using JavaScript to control playback.

Data Handling: Audio tracks are represented by file paths (tracks array) in the JavaScript code. In a real-world application, these paths could be fetched from a backend server or stored in a database.# Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship2
